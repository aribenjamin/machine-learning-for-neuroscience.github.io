# The Four Roles of Supervised Machine Learning in Systems Neuroscience

_Foreword_

Machine learning plays multiple roles in this dissertation. These roles are logically distinct, and represent the general roles that machine learning can play more broadly in neuroscience. Here, I describe these roles and review the literature in neuroscience in which machine learning plays each role. This chapter is reproduced from a review paper I co-authored, now published at Progress in Neurobiology. The aim of this review was to describe the potential uses so that other researchers might take a similar approach.  

Role 1 is to help create solutions to engineering problems. Chapter 1 features machine learning in this role, as do papers to which I contributed as a second author, especially Glaser et al. (2020)  (see Publications).

Role 2 is to help in identifying variables that are predictive of something, like neural activity or disease. This is role is played only by papers I contributed to as a middle author, especially Shen et al. (2020)  (see Publications).

Role 3 is to set benchmarks for simple models of the brain, as described in Chapter 2.

Role 4 is for machine learning to itself serve as a model for understanding the brain. This is exemplified by Chapters 3, 4, and 5.â€ƒ
