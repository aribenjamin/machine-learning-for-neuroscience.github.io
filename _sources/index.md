This is a version of my PhD dissertation that is designed to be read online. This format was developed by Patrick Minealt for [The Good Research Code Handbook](https://goodresearch.dev/), which itself which builds on [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) and [`tufte.css`](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/). 

If you would like to read this dissertation in a more traditional format, you can navigate to the [PDF version hosted on ProQuest](https://www.proquest.com/openview/e10a4f006cab070bc980ba0ebd2849eb).
